# Exercise 2
Speeding tickets
In this assignment you will ask the user for how fast a vehicle was going, and ask for the speed limit, and ask if it was a school zone, then calculate the amount of the traffic fine.
the speeding ticket fines are as follows:
| Location		 				| km/h over the speed limit | ticked amount |
|:------------------------------|:--------------------------|:--------------|
| Highways       				| 1-20						| $138			|
|								| 21-40						| $196			|
|								| 41-60						| $368			|
|								| 61+						| $483			|
|:------------------------------|:--------------------------|:--------------|
| school and construction zones | 1-20						| $196			|
|								| 21-40						| $253			|
|								| 41-60						| $368			|
|								| 61+						| $483			|
|:------------------------------|:--------------------------|:--------------|
| going 20km/h under the limit is also a offense with a ticket of $121		|

Also note that going 20 Km/h under the limit also is a driving offense with a ticket amount of $121.
