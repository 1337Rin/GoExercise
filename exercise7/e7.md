# Exercise 7

In this assignment you will be sorting an array of numbers using the bubble sort algorithm.  You must be able to sort both integers and doubles, and to do this you must overload a method.
Bubble sort work by repeatedly going over the array, and when 2 numbers are found to be out of order, you swap those two numbers.
This can be done by looping until there are no more swaps being made, or using a nested for loop, meaning the array of length n is checked n2 times. 

## Sample Run 1
```
Please enter the # of numbers to be sorted: 4
Enter 1 for int's or 2 for doubles: 2
Enter number: 4
Enter number: 3
Enter number: 2
Enter number: 1
3.0, 4.0, 2.0, 1.0
3.0, 2.0, 4.0, 1.0
2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 1.0
2.0, 3.0, 1.0, 4.0
2.0, 1.0, 3.0, 4.0
1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0
```

## Sample run 2
```
Please enter the # of numbers to be sorted: 5
Enter 1 for int's or 2 for doubles: 1
Enter number: 11
Enter number: 5
Enter number: 6
Enter number: 2
Enter number: 4
5, 11, 6, 2, 4
5, 6, 11, 2, 4
5, 6, 2, 11, 4
5, 6, 2, 4, 11
5, 2, 6, 4, 11
5, 2, 4, 6, 11
2, 5, 4, 6, 11
2, 4, 5, 6, 11
