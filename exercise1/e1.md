# Exercise 1
In this assignment you will compute how far an object has fallen in a given amount of time.  For example a group of teenagers jump off of a cliff, and know it takes 2 seconds to fall before they land in the lake below.  One of the teens claim that the cliff is 150 feet high, which is a fatal jumping height. Let’s calculate how far they fell. You will need the following equation:
```
x(t) = 0.5 × at2 
```

Variable
Meaning
Value

A
Acceleration (m/s)
9.81

T
Time (in seconds)

x(t)
Distance at time t

Also note that 1 meter = 3.28 feet

## Input
Your program will ask the user for an amount of time in seconds that the object was falling.  You should read in a double number.
Output
Your program should output the distance the object has fallen in that amount of time in both meters and feet.

## Sample Run
```
Please enter the amount of time in seconds that the object was falling for: 10
The object's position after 10.0 seconds is 490.50000000000006 meters or 1608.8400000000001 feet.
Or
The object's position after 10.0 seconds is 490.5 meters or 1608.84 feet.
```
