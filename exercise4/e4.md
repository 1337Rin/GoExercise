## Exercise 4

In this assignment you will use for loops to output asterisks (\*) in the shape of a large ‘X’ or ‘O’ . Your program should ask the user whether they want to see an ‘X’ or an ‘O’, and what size it should be. Your program should display the according shape (see below).

## Input
Your program will ask the user for an ‘X’ or an ‘O’ , and then ask for a positive int for the size of the associated shape.

## Output
Your program should output asterisks in the desired shape, in as many lines of text as the user asks for (see sample run).

## Sample Run 1
```
Would you like to see an X or O? X
What size should it be? 5

## Sample Run 2
```
Would you like to see an X or O? O
What size should it be? 5
