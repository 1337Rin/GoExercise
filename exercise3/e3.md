Craps Simulator

Craps is a popular dice game played in casinos, and my favorite casino game.  Write a program to play craps as follows:

Roll 2 standard dice (faces values 1-6).  The roll is the sum of the two dice.  The first roll is called the Come Out roll.  If the come out roll is a 7 or 11, you win, but if itâ€™s a 2,3 or 12 you lose.  If any other number is rolled, that number is then called the Point.  The object for the player is to keep rolling the dice hoping to get the same number as the point to win, before they roll a 7, which is craps and the player losses.
