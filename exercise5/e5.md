## Exercise 5

String Manipulation

You will write a program to validate passwords for users, making sure they meet the following criteria:
Rules:
- Passwords must be at least 8 characters long
- Passwords can only contain alpha numeric characters (no spaces or special characters)
- Passwords must contain at least 1 uppercase character
- Passwords must contain at least 1 lowercase character
- Passwords must contain at least 1 numeric character (0-9)
- Passwords cannot contain the word “password”

You must repeatedly ask the user for a password until the user enters “endofinput”

## Sample Run
```
Password: john

Password: John Doefoo 1

Password: passworD12
